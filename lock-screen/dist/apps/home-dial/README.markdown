# Home Dial

I've always wanted to make a dial with dynamic scales that could control the home. 

I love the Nest but I wanted to make something a little more minimalist. This is my first attempt.

A few ways to interact:

1.  Click an icon and drag the inner wheel to set its value.

2.  Hit 1,2,3 or 4 on your keyboard to select an icon and use the arrow keys to set its value. Hopefully this makes it more accessible.

3.  A combination of both!

The dial will remember your setting for each 'thing' (i.e. fan, volume etc).
